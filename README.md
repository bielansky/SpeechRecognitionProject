# SpeechRecognitionProject
First python project that I made during my python classes.

It's all about recognizing your speech and converting it into text.
Later you can either make a .txt file with your text or add more to the existing ones.
You can also make an .mp3 file (Speech synthesis) based on the text from the .txt file.
Currently it only supports 24 languages.
